#### Minutes
**Started at:** 12.15CET
**Present:** Everyone

:one: OKR discussions


1. We all agreed KR1 was reasonable. Not much discussion.
2. The point of having specs was not contentious.
Discussions on how to best implement the specs:
* Which repo(s) to create/contain the specs.
* Tag them for each release separately, or release them in on bulk.
* Bedeho to determine, feel free to comment on this.
3. We agreed on the concept of adding tranches. We may want to clarify what this actually entails, but should not be specified in the KR itself.
4. We agreed on the concept of "feature freeze", but the KR was poorly phrased.
Jens made a good point, which I hope is clarified in the KR now. (comments?)
5. We stop at four instead of forcing another KR. KISS.

As a consequence of `5.`, this seems more like a subrelease from a user POW. This makes it a smaller release, thus no point in straying away from the greek theme. The discussion led to the following OKR for Acropolis:


### Objective: `Launch Acropolis Network`
- **Active from:** 30.04.19
- **KR Measurement Deadline**: 7-9 days after Acropolis launch (first weekday)
- **Tracked**: Every Monday
- **Tracking Manager**: Martin
- **Key Results**:
1. `Get 200 posts on forum (limits, not Jsg) (ewd)`
    - Bedeho: 3/4
    - Alex: 1/4
2. `All n* modules fully specd (n)`
    - Bedeho: 1/2
    - Mokhtar: n_m/(n*2)
    - Alex: n_a/(n*2)
    - Jens: n_j/(n*2)
    - Bedeho: n_b/(n*2)    
3. `Add tranches to storage-node (ewd)`
    - Jens (2/3)
    - Mokhtar (1/3)
4. `No PRs merged to master (excluding bugfixes and "pioneer") after "Module Test" (ewd)`
    - Martin: 1/2
    - Jens: 1/8
    - Mokhtar: 1/8
    - Bedeho: 1/8
    - Alex: 1/8

`* Bedeho to define n, n_m, n_a, n_j, n_b`

:two: Projects, products and features
We did not explicitly address this point on the agenda, but it follows from the OKR that the main feature and leads are:

- Add an on-chain forum. Lead: Bedeho
- Make a detailed spec for all modules. Bedeho is the coordinator, but everyone will produce their own specs based on his template.
- Add tranches to the storage node. Lead: Jens.

:three: User stories meeting
The User StoriesÂ meeting is to be held on Tuesday at 12:15CET.

**Other Topics raised:**
No
