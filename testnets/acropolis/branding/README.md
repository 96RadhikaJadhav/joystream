# Name
Acropolis

# Naming Rational
We have a tradition of naming our testnets after cities, locations and empires that's been important in the evolution of democratic principles and the rule of law. After `Mesopotamia`, `Sparta` and `Athens`, we realized the next release would be smaller from a users POV. We therefore landed on `Acropolis`, as [The history of the Acropolis of Athens is long, with moments when democracy philosophy and art flourished, leading to its creation.](http://www.acropolisofathens.gr/aoa/).

# Goals
The major of goals of the Acropolis testnet is the following:

## Technical
The technical goals of Acropolis is to improve our technical credibility, and add two new features:

- `Specification` of all modules to improve onboarding for contributors, and set a good presedence for the platform.
- Add `tranches` to the storage-node, to allow users with limitid capacity to participate in a future with a large content directory.
- Introduce a `feature freeze` (bugfixes and PioneerÂ app excluded) after module test to avoid rushing releases without all features working.
- Introduce an on-chain `forum` for platform communication.

## Community
The main goals for the community is to introduce:

- A `forum` for communication
- Reduce the disc storage requirement for `Storage Providers` by introducing `tranches`.
