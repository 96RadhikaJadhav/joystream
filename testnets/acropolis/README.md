#  Specification

After [discussing](../../reports/archive/2.md) internally, the specs for Acropolis will be made using [this](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/blob/master/reports/archive/2-attachments/members-module.md) as a reference (link to be replaced after merge).

# GitHub Projects

The current set of relevant GitHub projects are

- [Acropolis Release](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/7)

# OKR results

NA.

# Release Plan

**This plan was made in advance, and anything below this line will not be updated inspite of changing circumstances.**

## Name

`Acropolis`

## Manager

`Martin`

## Release Date

20 June 2019, 12:00 (GMT+2)

## OKRs

# Release OKRs
### Objective: `Launch Acropolis Network`
- **Active from:** 09.05.19
- **KR Measurement Deadline**: 7-9 days after Acropolis launch (first weekday)
- **Tracked**: Every Monday
- **Tracking Manager**: Martin
- **Key Results**:
1. `Get 75 posts on forum (limits, not Jsg) (ewd)`
2. `Forum (runtime), storage (runtime and P2P) fully specd (n)`
3. `Have 4x replication for all 2 tranches on storage node (ewd)`
4. `95% uptime Storage Providers (ewd)`
5. `No PRs merged to master (excluding bugfixes and "pioneer") after "Sub-system Test" (conf)`


Go [here](../../okrs/#release-okrs) for more details and tracking.

## Constraints

- Major changes required for the [Storage Node/Colossus](#colossus) and storage system as a whole.

## Risks

- [Specification](#specification-plans) of new sub-systems may be more time consuming and iterative than anticipated.
- Risks are partially mitigated by extending the cycle for Acropolis. Somewhat ironically, this introduces some risk that the release might collide with peak holiday season.

## Deployment

On-chain upgrade of runtime. Scope and extent of migrations unknown.

## Products

The following public products will be part of this release.

### Runtime
