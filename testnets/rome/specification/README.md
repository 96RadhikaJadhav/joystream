# Document

The purpose of this document is to serve as a starting point for the implementation phase of the given testnet. It is only a starting point in the sense that the implementation effort will always depart from the up front specification to some, possibly substantial, extent, but no effort is made to synchronize the specification at any time. Instead, the any such synchronization would be done in the specification of a future network. The value of such a specification is primarily to establish a relatively precise shared understanding among all contributors to a testnet release.
