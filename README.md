Installation
------------

*Requirements*

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as Node package manager. It also
uses some node packages with native components, so make sure to install your
system's basic build tools.

On Debian-based systems:

```bash
$ apt install build-essential
```

On Mac OS (using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):

```bash
$ brew install libtool automake autoconf
```

*Building*

```bash
$ yarn install
```

The command will install dependencies, and make a `colossus` executable available:

```bash
$ yarn run colossus --help
```

*Testing*

Running tests from the repository root will run tests from all packages:

```
$ yarn run test
```
