| Date     | KR #1 | KR #2 | KR #3 | KR #4 | KR #5 |  Total  |

- **Notes**
1. `Although we only got 7 posts that counts, the forum was shipped successfully. We decided to grade it as two separate results.`
2. `The forum and storage runtime was fully spec'd, whereas the P2P aspect of the storage was considered too incomplete to publish.`
3. `We achieved more than 4x replication, but tranches had to be abandoned.`
4. `We split this up in two parts, where the end user uptime, and provider uptime was weighted at 0.5 each.`
5. `The storage node had non-bug fixes (improvements) merged to master after "Full test", whereas the forum side had none.`
