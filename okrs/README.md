#### OKR Notes

* For previous testnet, we have tried making each KR be a mix of pure technical implementation, and community engagement in one single release OKR. This has lead to:
  * confusion during tracking
  * unclear responsibilities and and primary focus (ie. make it work, or make it easy)
  * ambiguity around time and deadlines
  * disappointment when the technical work has been completed, but "marketing" failed due to time or unrealistic numbers
  * subjective/changing final grading to counter above point
* For these reasons, we have decided on a new approach:
  * separate the technical and community in two OKRs
  * make all KRs as clear, unambiguous and objective as possible (for grading)
  * make the tracking less subjective (as we have numbers from Tracking Issues as guides, not just the assigned individuals guesstimate)
